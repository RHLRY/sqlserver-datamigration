 the three SQL queries for backing up a database, retrieving backup header information, and restoring a database:

Backup Database:

This query performs a full database backup to a specified disk location with options for formatting, initialization, checksum, compression, and progress statistics.
sql
Copy code
BACKUP DATABASE YourDatabaseName
TO DISK = 'C:\Your\Backup\Path\YourFullBackupFile.bak'
WITH FORMAT, INIT, CHECKSUM, COMPRESSION = PAGE, STATS = 1;
Replace YourDatabaseName with your actual database name.
Restore Header Information:

This query retrieves information about the backup header without restoring the database. It's useful for checking details such as database name, backup start and finish dates, and the presence of a checksum.
sql
Copy code
RESTORE HEADERONLY
FROM DISK = 'C:\Your\Backup\Path\YourFullBackupFile.bak';
Restore Database:

This query restores a database from a specified backup file with options for overwriting existing databases, specifying the file location, and checking the backup's integrity.
sql
Copy code
RESTORE DATABASE YourRestoredDatabase
FROM DISK = 'C:\Your\Backup\Path\YourFullBackupFile.bak'
WITH REPLACE, STATS = 1;
Replace YourRestoredDatabase with the desired name for the restored database.
